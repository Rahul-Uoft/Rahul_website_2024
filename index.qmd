My name is Rahul Gopeesingh and I'm a 3rd year student at the University of Toronto. I'm currently studying the mathematical applications of economics and finance. I've always had a love for mathematics however in my opinion economics is one of the most powerful tools that one can use to think about the world. My interest in economics actually developed because I mistakenly started watching some online lectures for game theory thinking it was combinatorial game theory(math).
