title: "About Rahul"
---

I spent a lot of time training for mathematical contests and I have a passion for teaching math. I think everyone inherently enjoys solving problems, but hate being confused. Hence a lot of people think that they'r not a 'math person.' I really enjoy teaching my peers and especially look forward to the "Aha!" moment when they really get it. 


In my free time I really enjoy playing football(even though I'm not very good at it.) There is so much beauty to be found in a sport that unites the entire world despite its simplicity. I also enjoy a casual game of chess.
